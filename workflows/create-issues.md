## Goal
Transform high-level implementation tasks into specific, actionable development issues in **Linear** that engineers can execute with minimal ambiguity.

## Instructions
1. Review the Implementation Plan for specific tasks.
2. Generate individual issues for each logical unit of work.
3. **Linear Integration**: Use `python3 scripts/linear_tool.py create --title "[Title]" --description "[Description]" --team "[TeamID]"` to create each issue in Linear.
4. Include clear descriptions and context for each issue in the output.
5. Define specific acceptance criteria for completion.
6. Identify cross-task dependencies.
7. Provide specific testing or validation requirements for each issue.

## Output Format
Create a Markdown document or list of issues:

# Development Issues: [Feature Name]

## [Issue ID]: [Title]
- **Description**: [Actionable summary]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [List]
- **Dependencies**: [Other issues]
